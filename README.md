An online game which teaches you how to read music as you play! Real sheet music!

## Example

See it in action:

## Disclaimer/Instructions

I'm a band teacher. I literally didn't know what TypeScript was before starting this project. The site works well, but beware the code.

For example, I know you need to run  `npm install` after checking this out to get a bunch of dependencies, but I *don't* know why you then need to delete all instances of the word `export` from `howler/index.d.ts`. I just know it's my fault. Feel free to explain/help me clean up this mess!
