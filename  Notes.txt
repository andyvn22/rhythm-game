JGSW:
+ Display notation on an HTML page
+ Display notation on an HTML page on someone's computer that doesn't have the Bravura Text font installed
+ Display a time signature object
+ Display note objects
+ Bar automatically
+ Beam automatically
+ Play the rhythm
+ Scroll to where you are as it plays. I think there is a jQuery `scrollTop` property?
+ Count off before playing
+ Accept input & grade!!
+ Store offset info in fractions of a beat, so that you can...
    + create formatters for counts, and
    + add tooltips for details on timing!
+ Make Count a real type to clean up
+ Space extra clap markings according to offset
+ Populate levels based on query strings, by reading from one big ts file
+ Random level generation, based on some parameters to allow for practice of specific skills.
+ Fix bug that causes tooltips to stick forever when they appear during playback (why show them during playback anyway?)
+ Set up local server
+ Load the site on your phone
+ Fix any existing issues
    + Disable iOS double-tap-to-zoom
    + Make tooltips closer to notes
    + Decrease notation size for low-width screens
    + Check for touch events so timing is accurate on mobile devices
+ Make tooltips click to show/hide on phone
    + AUTOMATIC! Thanks Safari for iOS and/or jQuery UI!
+ Hide key commands on phone
+ Show correct counts under the music on graded notes; color the ones that line up with notes & give them the same tooltips as the notes
+ Add a "Tap" button
+ Refactor timing & grading into `MusicEvent`
    + Get timing out of `Note`
    + Move `MusicEvent`s off of `Note` and into a separate `Piece.events` array
    + Get grading out of `Player`... and `Piece`
        + You'll probably need to make `Piece.events` into a custom class to do this
+ Grade beats, coloring beats in the counting
+ Make tooltips mention both beats and notes
- Grade beats when beats occur
    - Is it now time to experiment with `window.requestAnimationFrame()`?
- Fix your spacing code to properly use the barline at the end of the measure as beat 1 instead of the first note of the next measure
- Add "extra beat" just like "extra clap"
- Fix spacing bug: it seems that offscreen objects don't work with your count/clap placement code.
    - Is this your fault or a limitation of the browser?
    - Can you use `div`s instead of `span`s for your notes, and if so, can you position relative to them?
- Add a final score summary that appears after the piece is finished
- Create a guided review of mistakes, suggested in the final score summary
- Create an option to practice a level at a slower tempo
- Create an option to practice certain measures from a level
- Fix block system so it can disallow larger blocks from crossing certain boundaries (e.g. eighth/quarter/eighth syncopation starting on beat 2 of common time)
    - Can you add an "allowed start" property to blocks, which is by default "anywhere"?
- Abstract level tree you can progress through
- Cool background music to help keep beat
- Add cool animations
- Browser local storage for progress?
- Can you store all player progress in a URL? This could allow switching devices!
- Accounts saved on server? based on hash of email; switching accounts on main page
	- If this isn't viable, how can you learn of students' progress?
- Rests
- Can you check counts via speech recognition?
- Add a link to explain why a note has the count it does
- Add special nodes to the level tree that are just explanations, that pass automatically on load
- Allow special nodes to include multiple choice or matching quizzes (for note recognition & beat length in time signatures)

POLISH:
- Give every glyph a special offset so that counts can be PERFECTLY aligned
- Move counts & extra claps & anything else relatively positioned when you resize the window
    - Can you achieve this automatically by using em positioning, or attaching them to note spans instead of the parent container?
- The lead distance on the scrolling is hardcoded to 100px, but should be em-based
- Close tooltips on scroll
- Does `window.requestAnimationFrame()` polling result in more accurate performance?
- Make grading hues quadratic instead of linear: it should be easier to get perfect greens.
- Get permission to host the Rhythms font for this project, or make your own
	- I'm concerned about spacing. :( You might need to make a custom font.
