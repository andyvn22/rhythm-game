JGSW:
+ Display notation on an HTML page
+ Display notation on an HTML page on someone's computer that doesn't have the Bravura Text font installed
+ Display a time signature object
+ Display note objects
+ Bar automatically
+ Beam automatically
+ Play the rhythm
+ Scroll to where you are as it plays. I think there is a jQuery `scrollTop` property?
+ Count off before playing
+ Accept input & grade!!
+ Store offset info in fractions of a beat, so that you can...
+ create formatters for counts, and
+ add tooltips for details on timing!
- Make Count a real type to clean up
- Space extra clap markings according to offset
- Refactor because it's getting ugly and weird.
- Random level generation, based on some parameters to allow for practice of specific skills.
- Lots of interface work! Big button? Space bar? Tapping on phones?
- Rests
- Abstract level tree you can progress through
- Accounts saved on server based on hash of email; switching accounts on main page

POLISH:
- Make grading hues quadratic instead of linear: it should be easier to get perfect greens.
- Get permission to host the Rhythms font for this project, or make your own
	- I'm concerned about spacing. :( You might need to make a custom font.
- Overlapping beams bother Safari--you've fixed this for inner notes with a hack to do a complete redraw each play, but you need to redraw at the end of a piece, too, and when claps are cleared for a re-try.

EXAMPLE TOOLTIP:
• This note is on the ma of 2
• You clapped on the ta of 3
• You were 2/3 of a beat late
