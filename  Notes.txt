JGSW:
+ Display notation on an HTML page
+ Display notation on an HTML page on someone's computer that doesn't have the Bravura Text font installed
+ Display a time signature object
+ Display note objects
+ Bar automatically
+ Beam automatically
+ Play the rhythm
+ Scroll to where you are as it plays. I think there is a jQuery `scrollTop` property?
+ Count off before playing
- Accept input & grade!!
- I'm very concerned about spacing. :( Do you need to make a custom font?
- Rests

POLISH:
- Make grading hues quadratic instead of linear: it should be easier to get perfect greens.
- Get permission to host the Rhythms font for this project, or make your own
- Overlapping beams bother Safari--you've fixed this for inner notes with a hack to do a complete redraw each play, but you need to redraw at the end of a piece, too.
